Browser soccer game
    The world cup is almost here, and in my excitement I made a soccer game. 
    
    The game includes different teams for the user to select, and each team includes a roster of 11 players that the user will then be able to access. The teams and rosers are all based off of current rosters from around the world. Behind the scenes each player has unique stats that also coincide with their real life ability (plus some enhancements for my favorite players). 

    Getting Started: 

    To play the game visit: 
    Simply follow the prompts bellow the feild and see what happens! If you are familiar with players, try and strategically select based on the game situation displayed on the feild. 

    Technologies used: JS, HTML, CSS

    Next Steps: 
        I will be adding teams and players to the game as often as I can as well as updating the css to look nicer! I also plan to improve the computer's ability to select players(currently it is random).
